        Syrian and Russian jets are stepping up strikes on opposition forces in
        northern Syria in retaliation for the sudden offensive that has cost the
        regime control of the country’s second largest city, Aleppo. The
        offensive has also led to the capture by the rebel alliance of an
        important military base east of Aleppo and large areas of both Aleppo
        and provinces. It has met little resistance on the ground from regime
        forces and also comes at a time when Syria’s key backers - Iran and
        Russia - are focusing on their own conflicts. The rebels’ sweeping
        success has posed the biggest challenge in eight years to President
        al-Assad, when Russian air power helped reverse rebel gains in the civil
        war. The newly formed rebel coalition, which calls itself the Military
        Operations Command, has captured key sites across Aleppo, including the
        airport, where video verified by CNN showed -clad fighters inside the
        main terminal.
